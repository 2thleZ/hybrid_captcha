# hybrid_captcha
This project aims to generate and solve hybrid CAPTCHA images that blend text-based CAPTCHAs with object images. We utilize a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) to recognize CAPTCHA text and a YOLOv8 model for object detection with semantic similarity analysis using SBERT.
